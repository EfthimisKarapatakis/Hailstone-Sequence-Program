# ðŸ”¢ Hailstone Sequence Program
This program generates the Hailstone sequence (also known as the Collatz sequence) for any given integer. 

## The sequence follows a simple set of rules:
1. If the number is even, divide it by 2.
2. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
3. Continue until the number becomes 1.
   
The program takes a user-provided number as input and prints the entire sequence until the value reaches 1.

## How It Works
The program works by following the Collatz conjecture:

* Starting with a user-provided number, the program repeatedly applies the rules described above.
* Each number in the sequence is printed on the screen.
* The sequence terminates when the number reaches 1.
